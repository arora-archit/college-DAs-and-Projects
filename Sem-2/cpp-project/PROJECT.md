[Code](main.cpp) 
## Features
-  There will be random questions every time
- There are three lifelines:
  1. ***Double dip:*** the user gets to answer the question
twice. The program asks for second choice if and only
if the first choice is incorrect.
  2. ***50:50:*** the program removes any two incorrect
options.
  3. ***Flip the question:*** the program changes the
question. However, user cannot use any other lifeline
to answer this question.
- The total winning price will be displayed at the end.
The final question will reward the greatest prize, i.e.
7,00,00,000.
- The program moves forward only if the answer
entered is correct. In case of a wrong answer, the
program is terminated and winning amount is
displayed according to the last cleared level.
